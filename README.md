# C-Mac-vs.-AD
Adrian Peterson was the last running back to win the MVP, which he did in 2012.  Christian McCaffrey is starting to garner attention for the award in 2023.  He won't come close to the rushing yards that Peterson put up in 2012, but his receiving yards have allowed him to close the gap somewhat.  His biggest competition?  Recent history and a teammate. Since Peterson won the award in 2012, quarterbacks have been selected MVP for 10 consecutive seasons.  49ers QB and teammate of McCaffrey, Brock Purdy, is the current favorite to win the award.  One advantage for McCaffrey is that he now plays a 17-game season compared to the 16-game season of Peterson.  How close can McCaffrey get to Peterson's total yardage of 2012 to improve his chances of winning the award?
